<!--
  This issue supplements SRE onboarding for tasks that are specific to starting an oncall shift. It is recommended that you create this issue and ensure you are familiar with these items on a regular basis.
  This checklist is separate from the SRE onboarding issue because the systems we provision and tooling we support evolves over time. Where SRE onboarding covers everything you should *know*, this issue should over everything you should be able to *do* before going oncall.

  If you are already familiar with the item listed, you should feel free to check it without going through the exercise.

- [ ] Find the latest auto-deploy pipeline on ops.gitlab.net and get the current deploy status on all environments using GitLab Chatops. [view documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/deploy/auto-deploy.md)
- [ ] Setup your workstation to ensure you have access to the zonal and regional k8s clusters. [view documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/kube/k8s-oncall-setup.md)

### Observability

- [ ] Locate the General SLA dashboard and find the panel for `Sidekiq Queue Lengths per Queue`
