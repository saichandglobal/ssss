<!-- title the issue: IMOC Rotation Volunteer - Volunteer Name -->

We will be using this information to assemble a schedule for shadowing and a longer term volunteer schedule, if you remain interested after your shadow rotation. We appreciate your time and your willingness to participate in capacity as an Incident Manager On-Call (IMOC), during the weekdays.

The [current responsibilities of an IMOC are locate in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#incident-manager-on-call-imoc-responsibilities) and as part of the volunteer program, you will be reverse-shadowed by a regular IMOC, should you require additional support.
